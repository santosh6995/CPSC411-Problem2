# CPSC411-Problem2
In this problem, you will develop an Android application, which displays a list of TextView widgets that is vertically organized on the screen. The width of each widget should be the same as the screen. Each widget displays the number of times the user clicks on that widget and the number should be located in the center of the widget. In addition, each widget will be painted with the Green color. Initially, all widgets should display 0. Each time a given widget is clicked, the number on it will be incremented by one. 

Please consider using the Android ListView widget for your implementation. Using ListView widget in this case will simply your implementation. If you decide to follow ListView-widget approach, then you can implement a data model to keep track of the click-counts for all TextView widgets and implement a ListView adapter to manage it.
